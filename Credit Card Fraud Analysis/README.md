# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraud detection is essential for ensuring financial security and minimizing losses due to unauthorized activities.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression

## 📈 Accuracy
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately **99%** on the test dataset.  
However, due to the class imbalance in the dataset, other metrics like **Recall** and **F1-Score** are also considered important to evaluate the model’s performance.
